Weapon Sound Pack - M16		by Catastic

This note is used to help you integrate the sound in your game.
Automatic weapons are more difficult to integrate for the shooting because of intense fire the player can do.I hope it will help.

A) Single shot:
For the single shot, you can easily use:
-M16_Shoot_SingleShot00#
-M16_Shoot_SingleShot_BulletCasing_00#

B) Automatic shot or burst mode:
	For automatic shot you can use:
	1) Shoot sound
		-M16_Shoot_Auto_00# for all shot
	2) End of shoot / Tail
		M16_Shoot_Auto_LastShoot_00#
		OR for the last shot:
		M16_Shoot_SingleShot00#
	3) Bullet casing
		M16_Shoot_SingleShot_BulletCasing_00#

--> this will help you avoiding too much sounds in same time.

If you have any problem to integrate them or you think something is missing, feel free to contact me, or use the unity asset comment section.

Thanks for purchasing this asset, and see you for new one!
