Sub Machine Gun - Uzi			Catastic Sound

--Shooting Note--

Because this kind of weapon is more complexe to integrate than a single shot weapon, I attach this note to help plug the shooting sound.

Single Shot:
For single shot, you can easily use the Smg_Uzi_Shoot_SingleShot_# at each shot.


Automatic Shot:
1) For automatic shot, you can plug Smg_Uzi_Shoot_Auto_# at each shot.
2) When the trigger is released, you have 2 choices:
	-Smg_Uzi_Shoot_Auto_Last# -> Last shot with tail
	-Smg_Uzi_Shoot_Auto_Last_Tail0# -> Only the tail sound.


If you have some difficulties to integrate some sfx or you think something is missing, please let us now.
Thanks
